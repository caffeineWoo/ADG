            What is an Operating System?
            An operating system (OS) is the interface between the user and the hardware.
            It implements a virtual machine that is easier to program than bare hardware.
            An OS provides standard services (an interface) which are implemented on the hardware, including:
                - Processes, CPU scheduling, memory management, file system, networking.
            The OS coordinates multiple applications and users (multiple processes) in a fair and efficient manner.
            The goal in OS development is to make the machine convenient to use (a software engineering problem) and efficient (a system and engineering problem).

            Why Study Operating Systems?
            Abstraction — how do you give the users the illusion of infinite resources (CPU time, memory, file space)?
            System design —tradeoffs between:
                - performance and convenience of these abstractions
                - performance and simplicity of OS
                - functionality in hardware or software
            Primary intersection point — OS is the point where hardware, software programming languages, data structures, and algorithms all come together.
            Curiosity — “look under the hood”.
            “Operating systems are among the most complex pieces of software yet developed”, William Stallings, 1994.

            Modern OS Functionality
            Concurrency
                - Multiple processes active at once
                - Processes can communicate
                - Processes may require mutually-exclusive access to some resource
                - CPU scheduling, resource management
            Memory management — allocate memory to processes, move processes between disk and memory
            File system — allocate space for storage of programs and data on disk
            Networks and distributed computing — allow computers to work together
            Security & protection

            What is an Operating System?
            A magician — provides each user with the illusion of a dedicated machine with infinite memory and CPU time.
            A government — allocates resources efficiently and fairly, protects users from each other, provides safe and secure communication.
            A parent — always there when you need it, never breaks, always succeeds.
            A fast food restaurant — provides a service everyone needs, always works the same everywhere (standardization).
            A complex system — but keep it as simple as possible so that it will work.
